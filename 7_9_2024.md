**Events of Note:**

*Meeting With Charlie, Jack and Jeremy 7/2/2024*
	Met with Jack and Charlie to discuss PDB and software
	Charlie will try to have the PDB firmware capable by Jack's return 7/23/2024 but hopefully sooner 
		PDB is missing some extremely specific connectors from PCB to PCB 
			workarounds exist
	___Software___
		Have to do
			*Startup program*
			1. CAN Interface 
				1. Try to use UART to send CAN addressed to motors on startup
			2. voltage sequence
				1. Low side high
				2. measure ADC
				3. high side high OR timeout 
			Estop Remote and on Bruce
				turn lowside off
		Nice to Do
			Battery monitor
			current monitor
		Would be Nice
			LED for error codes
			HMI development
	___Discussed Bruce frame issues___
		Have to do 
			Jetson impact protection
			Lid
			check with John about max robot weight
		Nice to do
			hard stops on legs
		Would be nice
			recessed hip motors
	


**Private Work**
BNO085 i2c

worked on solutions to BRUCE's frame issues
	Roll Bars
		light
		minimal machining
		minimal remaking of parts
		protect the jetson in all orientations
		can cushion rollbars with pipe insulation for full body protection
	mechanical button extensions for the jetson
		very light
		minimal
		could be a little complex
		does not help with impact protection

Talked with John about the CAN address used he used for the motors
	He did not use C++ so we are kind of on our own 
	Gave resources on the motors

**This weeks solved problems:**
	Communication with BNO085 initialized over i2c
	Jeremy Received the HMI screen (its very cool)
	Met with Charlie to cover what firmware needs to be written for the PDB

**Current Problems:**
	The BNO085 has a documented problem communicating with ESP32s it is theorized a 2k resistor from SDA to Vin solves this issue
	The Jetson has issues fitting in the frame without blocking ports to risk of damage

TO DOs (long term):
	CAN interface with motors
	Startup firmware
	HMI interface and comms--- Webserver?
	Bruce Hardware design
	 Bruce Hardware construction


**Planned Work:**
	Work on the HMI interface with LGLV interface builder 
		Someone using LVGL on our exact display -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdpRFgsxTwg
	Develop Roll bar and button extension idea for Bruce
