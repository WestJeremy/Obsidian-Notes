inverse dynamics controller that tracks set of task or output space accelerations by solving for dynamically consistent inputs, ground reactions forces and general accelerations. 

for a position y(p)=$\phi$ (q) and coresponding velocities y{^dot} ={J{_y}} 

compute feasible accelerations
{\ddot {y} } =\dot{J} \q +Jy\ddot{q}
