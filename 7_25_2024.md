**Events of Note:**
	Took some time off for traveling have returned
	Jack Returned on 23rd
	Charlie soldered up PDB with some hardware resoldering issues
	
	
	


**Private Work**
	HMI development 
		LVGL with EEZ Studio graphical programmer that interfaces with Platformio
	John has C++ firmware for the encoder for CAN address setting on git


**This weeks solved problems:**
	Software for HMI building chosen (EEZ)
	learned basics of EEZ studio




**Current Problems:**
	The BNO085 has a documented problem communicating with ESP32s it is theorized a 2k resistor from SDA to Vin solves this issue
	The Jetson has issues fitting in the frame without blocking ports to risk of damage

TO DOs (long term):
	CAN interface with motors
	Startup firmware
	HMI interface and comms--- Webserver?
		current voltage sensors
	Bruce Hardware design
	 Bruce Hardware construction


**Planned Work:**
	Work on the HMI interface with LGLV interface builder 
		Accelerometer readout on screen
